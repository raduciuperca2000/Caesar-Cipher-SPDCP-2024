Evening at Dorsia. Luis carves another fine rack of lamb, precisely the way I like it: pink in the center.  Everyone at Dorsia is here.  I see Tim Price in a thick, charcoal Brioni.  Impressive.  Impressive.  David Van Patten, too, in a double-breasted Zegna.  Harris doesn't look so bad either, though his Charvet tie clashes with his Dunhill suit.  I can't decide whether I like Evelyn's backless Yves Saint Laurent or Courtney's little number from obscure Czech designer everyone's talking about.
